# DIKI - Dictionary for Incivility Detection in German Online Discussions


Welcome! We are happy you want to use *DIKI* for your research ðŸ’ž


### About

This is a python web application based on the framework [streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started). It runs in your browser without installing any software on any operating system.
In this app, you can analyze how many uncivil expressions the texts (e.g., Tweets, user comments) in your data set contain by matching them with word lists (also called dictionaries) of German-language uncivil expressions (e.g., swear words or insults). Afterwards, you can download the results to your computer. The final file will include two new columns with the number of matches and the matched words.
Three dictionaries are provided that you can use via this web interface or download for individual use from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ankekat1000/DIKI).
