# DIKI Streamlit App

The App analyses text data using a so called _dictionary_ for incivility (which is basically a list of swear words). The App lets you select a (local) csv file to analyse and a dictionary (only 1 option so far). In the scope of the analysis, a new column including analysis information will be added to the read data frame. Finally, the manipulated data frame will be saved.
