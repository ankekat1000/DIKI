# DIKI Web App for Incivility Detection (German)

Welcome! We are happy you want to use our **DIKI WEB APP** ðŸ’ž Click [here](https://diki-web-app.herokuapp.com/) to start right away! 

### About

The Python-based Webapp runs in your browser (we recommend Firefox) without installing any software or packages on any operating system. The app is hosted by [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). 

### Dictionaries

For analyzing your data, we provide two word lists (dictionaries) for incivility in German-language online discussions. The app used the x-method to find entries of the dictionary in your uploaded data file. It will add two new columns to your data, one with the number of matches, and one with the matched words. Both your data and the key words will be transformed to lower case.
